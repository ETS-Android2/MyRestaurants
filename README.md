## Description

```bash

Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services.
Users can look up restaurants in their zip code, create secure and personalized accounts, log in and out, 
and save restaurants to their own custom list in Firebase. 
We've even included a flexible user interface that can display our content in the best manner for the device's current orientation, 
and hide any irrelevant elements depending on where the user is viewing a restaurant's details.
